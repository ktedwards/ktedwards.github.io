<h1>Project 1- Color Harmoney</h1>
<h1>Title: Lost In Japan</h1>
<img class="img-Project 1" src="img/Project 1.jpg" alt="lost In Japan" height="300" width="400">
<p>So when I was creating this piece I wanted to make somthing based off a cultrue that love to learn from. So when doing this I had never used photoshop for painting so it was intersiting</p>
<p>to see what we could create. I wanted to create it based off this old Japanese painting I saw at the CMA that was on display. I even checked out books from the school libraey that that taught me about</p>
<p>the type of clothes and and enviorment they live in that incorperated to my art.</p>

<p>certain situation our country was having at that time and that being the Califorina forest fires that was at the time a big problem that the public was facing.</p>

<h1>Project 3- Identity</h1>
<h1>Title: Who Am I</h1>
<img src="img/Project 3.jpg" alt="Who AM I" height="400" width="250">
<p>When I was creating this project I really struggled with creating this one because i'm still learning who I am and what my Identity to people I meet</p>
<p>I have many parts of myself i'm a shy person when it comes to some situations but in other im very outgoing and loud and when I developing this I wanted to display that.</p>
<p>I wanted to show my shy but okay side my happy and notcaring side and other things that desribe me. I wanted the display of it to be this sorta retro 90's or 80's</p>
<p>that sorta speaks to me beacause I have this sorta old soul to me.</p>

<h1>Project 4- Logo</h1>
<h1>Title: CIA and Personal Log</h1>
<img src="img/Project 4 .jpg" alt="CIA and Personal Logo" height="300" width="500"></a>
<p> When Creating the CIA Logo i wanted the logo to have this simple easy to understand font towards it when you first see it. I wanted the logo to have a 3D effect towards it,</p>
<p> I watched many Videos on layering in Illustrator on youtube to better understand how the process works and what I could incorperate in my art.</p>
<p>But when I was developing my own logo I wanted to create somthing not just simple but futeristic and geometric to my liking. I look at brands that I love such as Jaquemes,</p>
<p>Versace, Vogue. Brands that are famous and noticeable when you first look at them.</p>

<h1>Project 5- What's Your Message</h1>
<h1>Title: I'm not a Target</h1>
<img src="img/2020:10:24 Edwards_Karl Project 5 Logo.jpg" height="300" width="400"></a>
<p>For this project I wanted to not just display a message just for anyone but for a cause that has a deep meaning to me and that being the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>When creating this I wanted to not just give justice to cause but also put my own creative twist towards it. I wanted to change the symbol of the movement to somthing I created.</p>
<p>So after creating it to somthing personal I also wanted to add the victims of police burality that lost their lives to a system thats set against them.</p>

<h1>Title: Imagine Only Wanting This</h1>
<h1>Title: Feels Like Being Held Forever</h1>
<img src="img/Card 6.jpg" height="600" width="400"></a>
<p>When Developing this project for the assingment I truly wanted to find a quote from the book "imagine Only Wanting This" that didn't just connect with the reader but also myself.</p>
<p> I wanted the card to display this sort of feeling like that even thought were stuck in this certain moments in life dosent mean it will last forever.</p>
